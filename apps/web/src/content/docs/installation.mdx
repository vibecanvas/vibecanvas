This guide helps you get Vibecanvas running reliably on a new machine.

## 1) Install Bun

Follow the Bun install guide, then verify:

```bash
bun --version
```

## 2) Install and set up OpenCode

```bash
bun add -g opencode-ai
opencode
```

Vibecanvas uses OpenCode for agent sessions, so complete OpenCode setup before launching Vibecanvas.

## 3) Install Vibecanvas globally

```bash
pnpm add -g vibecanvas
```

Any package manager is fine; use the one your team already uses.

## 4) Launch from your project

```bash
cd your-project
vibecanvas
```

## 5) Verify core behavior

- App opens with canvas and side panels.
- Chat can start a new conversation.
- Project files appear in the workspace tree.

## 6) Keep Vibecanvas updated

```bash
vibecanvas upgrade --check
vibecanvas upgrade
```

The CLI upgrade command is built into `apps/server/src/main.ts`.
