This guide helps you get Vibecanvas running reliably on a new machine.

## 1) Install Bun

Follow the Bun install guide, then verify:

```bash
bun --version
```

## 2) Log in to Claude Code

```bash
claude
/login
```

Vibecanvas uses Claude Code and the Claude Agent SDK, so you should complete login before launching Vibecanvas.

## 3) Install Vibecanvas globally

```bash
pnpm add -g vibecanvas
```

Any package manager is fine; use the one your team already uses.

## 4) Launch from your project

```bash
cd your-project
vibecanvas
```

## 5) Verify core behavior

- App opens with canvas and side panels.
- Chat can start a new conversation.
- Project files appear in the workspace tree.

If one of these fails, ask in Discussions:
