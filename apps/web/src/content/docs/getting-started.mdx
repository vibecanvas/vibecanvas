Vibecanvas is a visual development workspace where you can sketch flows, discuss ideas with an agent, and iterate in one place.

## Prerequisites

- Bun installed on your machine.
- OpenCode CLI installed and set up.
- A local project folder where you want to work.

```bash
bun add -g opencode-ai
opencode
```

## Install

Pick your preferred package manager:

```bash
bun add -g vibecanvas
```

```bash
npm i -g vibecanvas
```

## Run

From your project directory:

```bash
vibecanvas
```

Once launched, open the canvas and start creating frames, notes, and task flows.

## Upgrade

```bash
vibecanvas upgrade --check
vibecanvas upgrade
```

Use `--check` for a dry run, or `upgrade` to install the latest version.

## What to do first

1. Create one canvas for your feature.
2. Add wireframes or flow boxes.
3. Open chat and ask the agent to break work into executable steps.
4. Keep docs open while implementing.
