Vibecanvas is a visual development workspace where you can sketch flows, discuss ideas with an agent, and iterate in one place.

## Prerequisites

- Bun installed on your machine.
- Claude Code CLI installed and logged in.
- A local project folder where you want to work.

```bash
claude
/login
```

## Install

Pick your preferred package manager:

```bash
bun add -g vibecanvas
```

```bash
npm i -g vibecanvas
```

## Run

From your project directory:

```bash
vibecanvas
```

Once launched, open the canvas and start creating frames, notes, and task flows.

## What to do first

1. Create one canvas for your feature.
2. Add wireframes or flow boxes.
3. Open chat and ask the agent to break work into executable steps.
4. Keep docs open while implementing.
