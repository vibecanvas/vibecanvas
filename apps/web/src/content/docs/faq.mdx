## What agents do you support?

Currently, Vibecanvas chat runs through **OpenCode**.

Install with:

```bash
bun add -g opencode-ai
```

Then run `opencode` once to complete setup.

## What can chat access right now?

Today, chat can read your local project files through the chat path you choose.

Current limitations:

- Chat does not see canvas elements directly yet.
- Chat can still get visual context if you paste screenshots from your clipboard into chat.

## Do my global OpenCode configs work in Vibecanvas?

Yes. Vibecanvas uses OpenCode sessions, so your global OpenCode setup is reused.

In practice, these global OpenCode features are valid in Vibecanvas chat:

- Agents
- Skills
- Commands

If they are available in your OpenCode CLI environment, they are generally available to sessions started by Vibecanvas.

## Why does chat UI look simpler than OpenCode?

The current chat UI does not expose every OpenCode capability yet.

Examples:

- Some OpenCode features are available in the runtime but not fully represented in the Vibecanvas chat interface.
- The UI is focused on core prompt + streamed response workflows first.
- Advanced OpenCode controls may be added to the UI in future releases.

## How do I upgrade Vibecanvas?

Use the built-in CLI command:

```bash
vibecanvas upgrade --check
vibecanvas upgrade
```
