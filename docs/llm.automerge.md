# Automerge

> Automerge is a local-first sync engine for multiplayer apps that works offline, prevents conflicts, and runs fast. It uses CRDTs to support all the JSON data types — and more, such as rich text. It's also available as part of Automerge Repo, a toolkit for building local-first applications, with various adaptors for sync and persistence included.
