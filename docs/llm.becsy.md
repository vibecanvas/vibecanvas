# Getting started

## ECS principles
Becsy is an Entity Component System (ECS) framework for web applications. The basic idea of this pattern is to move from defining application entities using a class hierarchy to using composition in a Data Oriented Programming paradigm. ([More info on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)). Structuring your application as an ECS can result in code that is more efficient and easier to extend over time.

Here's a short glossary of common ECS terms:
- [entities](architecture/entities): an object with a unique ID that can have multiple components attached to it.
- [components](architecture/components): different facets of an entity, e.g. geometry, physics, hit points. Data is only stored in components.
- [systems](architecture/systems): pieces of code that do the actual work within an application by processing entities and modifying their components.
- [queries](architecture/queries): used by systems to determine which entities they are interested in, based on the components attached to the entities.
- [world](architecture/world): a container for entities, components, systems and queries.

The usual workflow when building an ECS based program:
1. Create the *component* types that shape the data you need to use in your application.
2. Create *entities* and attach *components* to them.
3. Create the *systems* that will use these *components* to read and transform the data of *entities* selected by a *query*.
4. Execute all the *systems* each frame.

## Adding Becsy to your project
Becsy is published on `npm` under `@lastolivegames/becsy`.
```bash
npm install @lastolivegames/becsy
```

## Creating a world
A world is a container for entities, components and systems. Becsy supports just one world per process.

Let's start by creating our first world:
```ts
const world = await World.create();
```
```js
const world = await World.create();
```

## Defining components
Components are just objects that hold data.  We define them as behaviorless classes with some extra metadata about their properties.

```js
class Acceleration {
  static schema = {
    value: {type: Type.float64, default: 0.1}
  };
}

class Position {
  static schema = {
    x: {type: Type.float64},
    y: {type: Type.float64},
    z: {type: Type.float64}
  };
}
```
```ts
@component class Acceleration {
  @field({type: Type.float64, default: 0.1}) declare value: number;
}

@component class Position {
  @field.float64 declare x: number;
  @field.float64 declare y: number;
  @field.float64 declare z: number;
}
```

::: only-ts
The `@component` decorator will automatically register these component types with our world.  (Don't forget to add `"experimentalDecorators": true` to your `tsconfig.json`.)
:::

::: only-js
We also need to let the world know about our component types when creating it:

```js
const world = await World.create({defs: [Acceleration, Position]});
```
:::

[More information on how to define components types](architecture/components).

## Creating entities
Having our world created and some component types already defined, let's create [entities](architecture/entities) and attach new instances of these component types to them:
```js
world.createEntity(Position);
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  world.createEntity(
    Acceleration,
    Position, {x: Math.random() * 10, y: Math.random() * 10, z: 0}
  );
}
```
```ts
world.createEntity(Position);
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  world.createEntity(
    Acceleration,
    Position, {x: Math.random() * 10, y: Math.random() * 10, z: 0}
  );
}
```

With that, we have just created 11 entities: ten with the `Acceleration` and `Position` components, and one with just the `Position` component. Notice that the `Position` component is added using custom parameters. If we didn't use the parameters then the component would use the default values declared in the `Position` class or the fallback defaults (0, `null`, `false`, etc.).

[More information on creating and handling entities](architecture/entities).

## Creating a system
Now we are going to define [systems](architecture/systems) to process the components we just created. A system should extend the `System` class and can override a number of hook methods, though we'll only need `execute` to get started, which gets called on every frame.  We'll also need to declare [queries](architecture/queries) for entities we are interested in based on the components they own.

We will start by creating a system that will loop through all the entities that have a `Position` component (11 in our example) and log their positions.

```js
class PositionLogSystem extends System {
  // Define a query of entities that have the "Position" component.
  entities = this.query(q => q.current.with(Position));

  // This method will get called on every frame.
  execute() {
    // Iterate through all the entities on the query.
    for (const entity of this.entities.current) {
      // Access the component `Position` on the current entity.
      const pos = entity.read(Position);
      console.log(
        `Entity with ordinal ${entity.ordinal} has component ` +
        `Position={x: ${pos.x}, y: ${pos.y}, z: ${pos.z}}`
      );
    }
  }
}
```
```ts
@system class PositionLogSystem extends System {
  // Define a query of entities that have the "Position" component.
  entities = this.query(q => q.current.with(Position));

  // This method will get called on every frame.
  execute() {
    // Iterate through all the entities on the query.
    for (const entity of this.entities.current) {
      // Access the component `Position` on the current entity.
      const pos = entity.read(Position);
      console.log(
        `Entity with ordinal ${entity.ordinal} has component ` +
        `Position={x: ${pos.x}, y: ${pos.y}, z: ${pos.z}}`
      );
    }
  }
}
```

The next system moves each entity that has both a Position and an Acceleration.

```js
class MovableSystem extends System {
  // Define a query of entities that have "Acceleration" and "Position" components,
  // specifying that while we only need to read "Acceleration", we'll need to both
  // read and write "Position".
  entities = this.query(
    q => q.current.with(Acceleration).read.and.with(Position).write);

  // This method will get called on every frame by default.
  execute() {
    // Iterate through all the entities on the query.
    for (const entity of this.entities.current) {
      // Get the `Acceleration` component as read-only and extract its value.
      const acceleration = entity.read(Acceleration).value;

      // Get the `Position` component as read-write.
      const position = entity.write(Position);
      position.x += acceleration * this.delta;
      position.y += acceleration * this.delta;
      position.z += acceleration * this.delta;
    }
  }
}
```
```ts
@system class MovableSystem extends System {
  // Define a query of entities that have "Acceleration" and "Position" components,
  // specifying that while we only need to read "Acceleration", we'll need to both
  // read and write "Position".
  entities = this.query(
    q => q.current.with(Acceleration).read.and.with(Position).write);

  // This method will get called on every frame by default.
  execute() {
    // Iterate through all the entities on the query.
    for (const entity of this.entities.current) {
      // Get the `Acceleration` component as read-only and extract its value.
      const acceleration = entity.read(Acceleration).value;

      // Get the `Position` component as read-write.
      const position = entity.write(Position);
      position.x += acceleration * this.delta;
      position.y += acceleration * this.delta;
      position.z += acceleration * this.delta;
    }
  }
}
```

This system's query holds a list of entities that have both `Acceleration` and `Position`; 10 in total in our example.

Note that we are accessing components on an entity by calling:
- `read(Component)`: if the component will be used as read-only.
- `write(Component)`: if we plan to modify the values on the component.
And a query in the system must make the corresponding declarations for the components or the accesses will fail at runtime.

We could create an arbitrary number of queries if needed and process them in `execute`, for example:
```js
class SystemDemo extends System {
  boxes = this.query(q => q.current.with(Box));
  balls = this.query(q => q.current.with(Ball));

  execute() {
    for (const entity of this.boxes.current) { /* do things with box-like entity */ }
    for (const entity of this.balls.current) { /* do things with ball-like entity */ }
  }
}
```
```ts
@system class SystemDemo extends System {
  boxes = this.query(q => q.current.with(Box));
  balls = this.query(q => q.current.with(Ball));

  execute() {
    for (const entity of this.boxes.current) { /* do things with box-like entity */ }
    for (const entity of this.balls.current) { /* do things with ball-like entity */ }
  }
}
```

::: only-js
Just like for component definitions, we'll need to let our world know about these systems:

```js
const world = await World.create({
  defs: [Acceleration, Position, PositionLogSystem, MovableSystem]
});
```
:::

More information on [systems](architecture/systems) and [queries](architecture/queries).

## Running the systems
Now you just need to invoke `world.execute()` per frame. Currently Becsy doesn't provide a default scheduler, so you must do it yourself:
```js
async function run() {
  // Run all the systems
  await world.execute();
  requestAnimationFrame(run);
}

run();
```
```ts
async function run() {
  // Run all the systems
  await world.execute();
  requestAnimationFrame(run);
}

run();
```

## Putting everything together
```js
import {System, Type, World} from '@lastolivegames/becsy';

class Acceleration {
  static schema = {
    value: {type: Type.float64, default: 0.1}
  };
}

class Position {
  static schema = {
    x: {type: Type.float64},
    y: {type: Type.float64},
    z: {type: Type.float64}
  };
}

class PositionLogSystem extends System {
  entities = this.query(q => q.current.with(Position));

  execute() {
    for (const entity of this.entities.current) {
      const pos = entity.read(Position);
      console.log(
        `Entity with ordinal ${entity.ordinal} has component ` +
        `Position={x: ${pos.x}, y: ${pos.y}, z: ${pos.z}}`
      );
    }
  }
}

class MovableSystem extends System {
  entities = this.query(
    q => q.current.with(Acceleration).read.and.with(Position).write);

  execute() {
    for (const entity of this.entities.current) {
      const acceleration = entity.read(Acceleration).value;
      const position = entity.write(Position);
      position.x += acceleration * this.delta;
      position.y += acceleration * this.delta;
      position.z += acceleration * this.delta;
    }
  }
}

const world = await World.create({
  defs: [Acceleration, Position, PositionLogSystem, MovableSystem]
});


world.createEntity(Position);
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  world.createEntity(
    Acceleration,
    Position, {x: Math.random() * 10, y: Math.random() * 10, z: 0}
  );
}

async function run() {
  await world.execute();
  requestAnimationFrame(run);
}

run();
```
```ts
import {component, field, system, System, Type, World} from '@lastolivegames/becsy';

@component class Acceleration {
  @field({type: Type.float64, default: 0.1}) declare value: number;
}

@component class Position {
  @field.float64 declare x: number;
  @field.float64 declare y: number;
  @field.float64 declare z: number;
}

@system class PositionLogSystem extends System {
  entities = this.query(q => q.current.with(Position));

  execute() {
    for (const entity of this.entities.current) {
      const pos = entity.read(Position);
      console.log(
        `Entity with ordinal ${entity.ordinal} has component ` +
        `Position={x: ${pos.x}, y: ${pos.y}, z: ${pos.z}}`
      );
    }
  }
}

@system class MovableSystem extends System {
  entities = this.query(
    q => q.current.with(Acceleration).read.and.with(Position).write);

  execute() {
    for (const entity of this.entities.current) {
      const acceleration = entity.read(Acceleration).value;
      const position = entity.write(Position);
      position.x += acceleration * this.delta;
      position.y += acceleration * this.delta;
      position.z += acceleration * this.delta;
    }
  }
}

const world = await World.create();

world.createEntity(Position);
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  world.createEntity(
    Acceleration,
    Position, {x: Math.random() * 10, y: Math.random() * 10, z: 0}
  );
}

async function run() {
  await world.execute();
  requestAnimationFrame(run);
}

run();
```

# Components

A *component* is an object that can store data but should have no behavior (as that's handled by systems).  You'll typically have many instances of a component type, each held in an entity.  (Though sometimes you'll have [singletons](./systems#singleton-components).)

In Becsy, a component type is just a class with a default, empty constructor, and a schema that specifies the type of each field so that Becsy can allocate the right kind of storage:

```js
import {Type} from '@lastolivegames/becsy';

class ComponentA {
  static schema = {
    booleanValue: Type.boolean,
    integerValue: {type: Type.uint32, default: 10},
    stringValue: {type: Type.dynamicString(32)}
  };
}
```
```ts
import {component, field, Type} from '@lastolivegames/becsy';

@component class ComponentA {
  @field.boolean declare booleanValue: boolean;
  @field({type: Type.uint32, default: 10}) declare integerValue: number;
  @field.dynamicString(32) declare stringValue: string;
}
```

Each field in the schema represents one property on the component's instances, and can also be used to set default values.  Some component types are used just as tags and don't store any data, in which case your should omit the schema to enable some optimizations.

::: danger
You must only set the fields declared in your schema on component instances.  Any other properties will be dropped.
:::

::: tip
For components with a single field it might be tempting to name it the same as the component, but this leads to awkward code when accessing it later, e.g., `entity.read(Acceleration).acceleration`.  Instead, we recommend naming the sole field `value` so the code becomes `entity.read(Acceleration).value` instead.
:::

::: only-ts
The schema declared in the component somewhat duplicates the TypeScript property types, but it's necessary as Becsy uses primitive-valued array buffers that don't map cleanly to JavaScript values.  It's also important to use the `declare` keyword so that Becsy can take full control of the property definitions.

The `@component` decorator is optional; if included, it automatically adds the class to every world's `defs` list (as long as the module has been imported before the world is created, of course).
:::

While you should generally keep behavior out of components &mdash; lest you fall into an object-oriented architecture instead &mdash; we think it's fine and useful to, for example, define generic getters and setters on your component classes to assist with data wrangling.  This is especially the case if you're packing multiple values into a field using bit-level operations to lower your memory footprint.

::: warning
To interact with components in any way (add, read, write, remove), your systems need to declare [access entitlements](./queries#declaring-entitlements) in their queries.
:::

## Field types

::: only-js
Becsy makes available the following field types as static members on the `Type` class.  They're tightly integrated with the engine so it's not possible to add new ones in your app.

:::

Unless otherwise stated, the types are strict and don't accept `null` or `undefined` as values.

| Type <span style="float:right; font-weight: normal;">(default, JS type)</span> |
| --- |
| **`boolean`** <span style="float:right">(`false`, `boolean`)</span> <br><span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em;">&#8203;</span>A simple boolean type that accepts only `true` and `false` values. Each value occupies a full byte, though. |
| **`int8`, `uint8`, `int16`, `uint16`, `int32`, `uint32`** <span style="float:right; font-weight: normal;">(`0`, `number`)</span> <br><span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em;">&#8203;</span>Integer types of various bit sizes, both signed and unsigned (the latter with a `u` prefix). |
| **`float32`, `float64`** <span style="float:right; font-weight: normal;">(`0`, `number`)</span> <br><span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em;">&#8203;</span>Single and double precision floating point number types.  `float64` is equivalent to JavaScript's `number` type. |
| **`vector(type, elements, class?)`** <span style="float:right; font-weight: normal;">(`[0, 0, ...]`, `Array`)</span><br><span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em;">&#8203;</span>Fixed-length array of one of the numeric types above; see [below](#numeric-vectors) for details. |
| **`dynamicString(maxUtf8Length: number)`** <span style="float:right; font-weight: normal;">(`''`, `string`)</span> <br><span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em;">&#8203;</span>A string type that accepts any string value as long as it doesn't exceed the given maximum length when encoded with UTF-8. Useful for unpredictable strings such as usernames. |
| **`staticString(choices: string[])`** <span style="float:right; font-weight: normal;">(first choice, `string`)</span> <br><span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em;">&#8203;</span>A string type that can only be set to values from a preselected array of strings.  The value is stored as an integer index into the string array so it's very efficient, but you cannot add new string values at runtime. Useful for message strings built into your application. |
| **`object`** <span style="float:right; font-weight: normal;">( `undefined`, any)</span> <br><span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em;">&#8203;</span>A type that can accept any JavaScript object as value, including `undefined` and `null`.  This should only be used for interfacing with other libraries as it can't be shared between threads and doesn't perform as well as the primitive types even on a single thread. |
| **`weakObject`** <span style="float:right; font-weight: normal;">(`undefined`, any)</span> <br><span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em;">&#8203;</span>A weak reference to a JavaScript object that won't prevent it from being garbage collected.  It suffers from the same disadvantages as `object` above.  Values default to `undefined`, and automatically become `undefined` when the object is garbage collected. |
| **`ref`** <span style="float:right; font-weight: normal;">(`null`, `Entity`)</span> <br><span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em;">&#8203;</span>A unidirectional reference to a single entity or `null`; see [below](#referencing-entities) for details. |
| **`backrefs(type?, fieldName?, trackDeletedBackrefs?)`** <span style="float:right; font-weight: normal;">(`[]`, `Entity[]`)</span> <br><span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em;">&#8203;</span>An automatically populated list of references to the entity that contains a component with this field; see [below](#referencing-entities) for details.  Fields with this type cannot be set by your application. |

## Numeric vectors

When you need a component to hold some numeric values of the same type, you can of course declare them as separate fields.  However, it often makes sense to treat them as a single, composite value, whether for better organization, for increased performance due to cache locality, or to fit in with a third party API.  In that case you can declare a vector field instead:

```ts
@component class MovingEntity {
  @field.float64.vector(3)
  declare position: [number, number, number] & {asTypedArray(): Float64Array};
  @field.float64.vector(3)
  declare velocity: [number, number, number] & {asTypedArray(): Float64Array};
}

world.build(sys => {
  const player = sys.createEntity(
    MovingEntity, {position: [10, 0, 10], velocity: [1.5, 0.2, 0.1]}
  );
  const mover = player.write(MovingEntity);
  for (let i = 0; i < move.position.length; i++) {
    move.position[i] += mover.velocity[i];
  }
});
```
```js
class MovingEntity {
  static schema = {
    position: Type.vector(Type.float64, 3),
    velocity: Type.vector(Type.float64, 3)
  };
}

world.build(sys => {
  const player = sys.createEntity(
    MovingEntity, {position: [10, 0, 10], velocity: [1.5, 0.2, 0.1]}
  );
  const mover = player.write(MovingEntity);
  for (let i = 0; i < mover.position.length; i++) {
    move.position[i] += mover.velocity[i];
  }
});
```

This declares two fields, each a vector of exactly three `float64` numbers.  A vector's number elements will be stored together compactly by Becsy, and the vector will appear as an array-like object with a `length` property and indexed accessors for its properties.  You can access the elements individually, and you can also assign an array of the correct length to the field, which will get its elements copied into the component.  You can even iterate over it with a `for..of` loop, but be careful: for better performance, a vector has a single iterator that will be reset for everyone each time you start iterating, and the iterator will only work for as long as the vector's entity handle remains valid itself.

::: warning
While a vector appears array-like, it is not an actual JavaScript array:  it has a fixed length, and lacks any of the usual `Array` methods.
:::

Additionally, a vector has an `asTypedArray()` method that returns a typed array view onto the underlying data, which can be useful with low-level APIs.  While this requires an allocation it doesn't actually copy any data around, so it's still pretty light-weight.

::: warning
You must only access the typed array while the corresponding entity handle is valid.  Furthermore, you must not write to a typed array obtained from a read-only handle (unfortunately, there's no way to enforce this prohibition but if you do you're into undefined behavior territory).
:::

For better readability, you can also name the vector's elements and access them that way:
```ts
@component class MovingEntity {
  @field.float64.vector(['x', 'y', 'z'])
  declare position: [number, number, number] & {x: number, y: number, z: number};
  @field.float64.vector(['x', 'y', 'z'])
  declare velocity: [number, number, number] & {x: number, y: number, z: number};
}

world.build(sys => {
  const player = sys.createEntity(
    MovingEntity, {position: [10, 0, 10], velocity: {x: 1.5, y: 0.2, z: 0.1}}
  );
  const mover = player.write(MovingEntity);
  mover.position[0] += mover.velocity.x;
  mover.position.x += mover.velocity[1];
  mover.position.z += mover.velocity.z;
});
```
```js
class MovingEntity {
  static schema = {
    position: Type.vector(Type.float64, ['x', 'y', 'z']),
    velocity: Type.vector(Type.float64, ['x', 'y', 'z'])
  };
}

world.build(sys => {
  const player = sys.createEntity(
    MovingEntity, {position: [10, 0, 10], velocity: {x: 1.5, y: 0.2, z: 0.1}}
  );
  const mover = player.write(MovingEntity);
  mover.position[0] += mover.velocity.x;
  mover.position.x += mover.velocity[1];
  mover.position.z += mover.velocity.z;
});
```

You can then access the elements interchangeably either by index or by name, and assign either an array or an object to the field, whichever's more convenient.

Finally, you can specify a custom class to use for the array-like value.  This can be useful if you're using a library that provides a vector-like abstract data type with useful methods that you'd like to be able to use directly on your Becsy data.  It differs from using `Type.object` because the data is still stored by Becsy in a multithreading-compatible fashion, and fungible instances of the custom class are used as a thin veneer on top.  To achieve this, the vector's array-like and named element properties are used to override the class's ones, which works well for simple ADTs but can break the host class in more complex cases &mdash; you won't know until you try.

::: tip
For convenience, you might also want to declare the field type once for reuse throughout your components.
:::

Here's a made-up example that incorporates all of the above:

```ts
class Vector3 {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  z: number;

  add(that: Vector3): void {
    this.x += that.x;
    this.y += that.y;
    this.z += that.z;
  }
}

const v3Type = Type.vector(Type.float64, ['x', 'y', 'z'], Vector3);

@component class MovingEntity {
  @field(v3Type) declare position: Vector3;
  @field(v3Type) declare velocity: Vector3;
}

world.build(sys => {
  const player = sys.createEntity(
    MovingEntity, {position: [10, 0, 10], velocity: [1.5, 0.2, 0.1]}
  );
  const mover = player.write(MovingEntity);
  mover.position.add(mover.velocity);
});
```
```js
class Vector3 {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  z: number;

  add(that: Vector3): void {
    this.x += that.x;
    this.y += that.y;
    this.z += that.z;
  }
}

const v3Type = Type.vector(Type.float64, ['x', 'y', 'z'], Vector3);

class MovingEntity {
  static schema = {
    position: v3Type,
    velocity: v3Type
  };
}

world.build(sys => {
  const player = sys.createEntity(
    MovingEntity, {position: [10, 0, 10], velocity: [1.5, 0.2, 0.1]}
  );
  const mover = player.write(MovingEntity);
  mover.position.add(mover.velocity);
});

## Referencing entities

Applications often need to establish relationships between entities, and Becsy caters for this need directly with `Type.ref` and `Type.backrefs` properties.

::: warning
You should never reference entities via their IDs or as `Entity` objects held in `Type.object` properties.
:::

A `Type.ref` field holds a reference to any other single entity, or `null` to indicate that it's empty.  It will automatically be nulled out if the target entity is deleted, though its previous value remains accessible via `System.accessRecentlyDeletedData` until the reference is overwritten or the deleted entity purged.

A `Type.backrefs` field automatically builds a list of references to the entity on which its component resides.  Becsy automatically processes reference changes and entity deletions to keep the list current and it cannot be modified manually.  The order of the entities in the list is arbitrary.

::: info
A system that modifies `ref` properties also needs `write` entitlements to all the component types with `backrefs` that might change automatically in response, as these are treated as implicit writes.
:::

A `backrefs` field can be configured in a few different ways:
- By default, with no parameters, all references to the entity will be included.  This is the cheapest option as Becsy needs to maintain such backrefs for itself anyway.
- If you specify a component type then only references from components of that type will be included.  This is the most expensive option as Becsy needs to allow for the possibility of multiple `ref` properties in a component pointing to the same entity.
- If you specify both a component type and the name of a `ref` field name in that component then only references from that field will be included.  This is more expensive than the default of all references but safer, as the `backrefs` won't pick up any other references that you might add later to your application. It's also cheaper than specifying just a component type.
- Finally, by default you cannot read `backrefs` properties when operating under `System.accessRecentlyDeletedData` conditions.  If you need to do that then pass an extra flag to the type constructor to track deleted backrefs, but be aware that this will effectively double the cost of the field.

The `backrefs` field type lets you build 1-*N* relationships where the *N* is unbounded.  For example, you could model an inventory this way:

```ts
@component class Packed {
  @field.ref declare holder: Entity;
}

@component class Inventory {
  @field.backrefs(Packed, 'holder') declare contents: Entity[];
}

world.build(sys => {
  const player = sys.createEntity(Inventory, Health, /* etc */);
  const potion = sys.createEntity(Potion, {healing: 200});
  const sword = sys.createEntity(Sword, {damage: 50});

  // Put both items in the player's inventory
  potion.add(Packed, {holder: player});
  sword.add(Packed, {holder: player});
  player.read(Inventory).contents;  // [potion, sword] in any order

  // Remove the sword from the inventory
  sword.remove(Packed);
  player.read(Inventory).contents;  // [potion]

  // Destroy the potion
  potion.delete();
  player.read(Inventory).contents;  // []
});
```
```js
class Packed {
  static schema = {
    holder: Type.ref
  };
}

class Inventory {
  static schema = {
    contents: Type.backrefs(Packed, 'holder')
  };
}

world.build(sys => {
  const player = sys.createEntity(Inventory, Health, /* etc */);
  const potion = sys.createEntity(Potion, {healing: 200});
  const sword = sys.createEntity(Sword, {damage: 50});

  // Put both items in the player's inventory
  potion.add(Packed, {holder: player});
  sword.add(Packed, {holder: player});
  player.read(Inventory).contents;  // [potion, sword] in any order

  // Remove the sword from the inventory
  sword.remove(Packed);
  player.read(Inventory).contents;  // [potion]

  // Destroy the potion
  potion.delete();
  player.read(Inventory).contents;  // []
});
```

To build an *N*-*N* relationship you'll need to reify the relationship itself as an entity to provide a level of indirection to the links.  Here's an example of a symmetric relationship:

```ts
@component class Friendship {
  @field.ref declare a: Entity;
  @field.ref declare b: Entity;
}

@component class Person {
  @field.backrefs(Friendship) declare friendships: Entity[];
}

world.build(sys => {
  const p1 = sys.createEntity(Person);
  const p2 = sys.createEntity(Person);
  const p3 = sys.createEntity(Person);

  // Set up some friendships
  const f1 = sys.createEntity(Friendship, {a: p1, b: p2});
  const f2 = sys.createEntity(Friendship, {a: p1, b: p3});
  p1.read(Person).friendships;  // [f1, f2] in any order
  p1.read(Person).friendships.map(f => f.a === p1 ? f.b : f.a);  // [p2, p3] in any order
})
```
```js
class Friendship {
  static schema = {
    a: Type.ref,
    b: Type.ref
  };
}

class Person {
  static schema = {
    friendships: Type.backrefs(Friendship)
  };
}


world.build(sys => {
  const p1 = sys.createEntity(Person);
  const p2 = sys.createEntity(Person);
  const p3 = sys.createEntity(Person);

  // Set up some friendships
  const f1 = sys.createEntity(Friendship, {a: p1, b: p2});
  const f2 = sys.createEntity(Friendship, {a: p1, b: p3});
  p1.read(Person).friendships;  // [f1, f2] in any order
  p1.read(Person).friendships.map(f => f.a === p1 ? f.b : f.a);  // [p2, p3] in any order
})
```

## Validating component combos

In the ECS paradigm every entity can have one component of each type.  However, not all component combinations will make sense in your application, and some might have deleterious effects on the systems processing them.  While in principle you could "just be careful" to not put together incompatible components that can be hard to do in practice as your application grows.

You can enlist Becsy's help in checking for invalid component combinations by defining a static `validate` method on any component type.  *All* such validation methods will be called on *all* entities that had component added or removed by a system, after that system has finished executing.  (So even though a validation method is defined on a specific component type for convenience, it can actually validate any components on all entities.)

::: info
Component validation is disabled in the [performance build](../deploying).
:::

Here's an example where we want to forbid combining component types `B` and `C` together if an entity also has a component of type `A`:
```ts
@component class A {
  static validate(entity: Entity): void {
    if (entity.has(A) && entity.hasAllOf(B, C)) {
      throw new Error('cannot combine both B and C with A');
    }
  }
}

@component class B {}
@component class C {}

world.build(sys => {
  const entity = sys.createEntity(A, B, C);
  // not an error yet -- we could still fix things by removing A, B or C
});
// but once the system finishes an error is thrown
```
```js
class A {
  static validate(entity: Entity): void {
    if (entity.has(A) && entity.hasAllOf(B, C)) {
      throw new Error('cannot combine both B and C with A');
    }
  }
}

class B {}
class C {}

world.build(sys => {
  const entity = sys.createEntity(A, B, C);
  // not an error yet -- we could still fix things by removing A, B or C
});
// but once the system finishes an error is thrown
```

A validation method can only check for the presence of components using the "`has`" family of methods on `Entity`.  It cannot `read` the entity to access the field values, so your component constraints cannot depend on data values.  Validators are also exempt from the system's access entitlements &mdash; they can check for the presence or absence of every type of component.

## Component enums

A very common restriction on component combinations is to allow at most one from a list of types to be present on an entity.  This is similar to "enums" in many programming languages and is often used to implement state machines.  Becsy supports this pattern directly and throws in a few extra features to boot.

You can define an enum and populate it with component types like so:
```js{4-5}
class A {}
class B {}
class C {}
// Define an enum of component types A, B, and C.
const myEnum = World.defineEnum('myEnum', A, B, C);
```
```ts
const myEnum = World.defineEnum('myEnum');
@component(myEnum) class A {}
@component(myEnum) class B {}
@component(myEnum) class C {}
```
::: only-ts
(You can also list the component types directly as part of the enum's definition instead.)
:::

Any component types can be members of an enum, including ones with data fields.  The enum name parameter is optional but will make any error message more useful.  Passing the enum or any one of its members into the world's `defs` will automatically pull in all the rest.

::: warning
A component type can be a member of at most one enum.
:::

In general, enum components are used just like normal ones, and the enum itself can be used to represent the list of its members in any API that deals with components.  The following chapters will also call out enum-specific features in each area.

## Storage strategies

Behind the scenes, rather than putting field values in properties of individual objects, Becsy stores them in contiguous, homogeneous buffers.  All the values for field `foo` of all components of type `A` are stored in one buffer, all the values for field `bar` in another, and so on.  There are different strategies for allocating and indexing these buffers that offer trade-offs between memory usage and performance.  (Note, though, that except for the `compact` storage strategy, performance differences only show up in the [performance build](../deploying)).

You can select a storage strategy per component type by filling in a static `options` object in the class.  For example:
```ts
@component class A {
  static options = {
    storage: 'packed',
    capacity: 1000
  }
}
```
```js
class A {
  static options = {
    storage: 'packed',
    capacity: 1000
  }
}
```

You can also set a default storage strategy for components that don't specify one by passing `defaultComponentStorage` to the `World.create` options.  The default default is `packed` (elastic).

The available strategies are as follows, in order from fastest and most memory hungry to slowest and smallest.

- **`sparse`**:  This strategy allocates storage for every possible entity up front, indexed directly by entity ID.  This is very fast as there's no indirect indexing step but can be extremely wasteful unless all or nearly all entities have a component of the given type.  (You cannot specify a `capacity` or an `initialCapacity` for this strategy.)

- **`packed`**:  This strategy allocates storage for a full index lookup table (up to 4 bytes for every possible entity), but uses smaller buffers for the actual field values.  If you know the maximum number of components of a given type you can set the value buffers to a fixed size using the `capacity` option.  If you don't know, the strategy defaults to an elastic variant that will grow the buffers as needed (though never shrink them).  You can set the `initialCapacity` of these elastic buffers, but note that they're slower than the fixed size ones even if they never actually get resized.

- **`compact`**: This strategy uses both a small index lookup table and smaller value buffers, but accessing a value requires a *linear* scan of the index so it's only recommended if you have no more than a handful of components of a given type.  Like the `packed` strategy there are both fixed size and elastic variants.  This strategy is automatically applied to any component types used as [singletons](./systems#singletons).

::: tip
When setting the storage `capacity` of a component type, remember to factor in that deleted entities [hang around for up to 2 frames](./entities#deleting) before they are purged.

# Entities
An entity is an object that has a unique ID, very much like a JavaScript object. Its purpose is to group components together; it may have up to one component of each type.

![Entities](./images/entities.svg)

## Creating entities

You can create entities by invoking `createEntity` [on your world](./world#creating-entities) or [on a system](./systems#creating-entities).  You pass in the types of the components that you want the entity to start out with, each optionally followed by initial values to assign to the component's fields.

```js
world.createEntity(ComponentFoo, {foo: 'bar', baz: 42}, ComponentBar);
```
```ts
world.createEntity(ComponentFoo, {foo: 'bar', baz: 42}, ComponentBar);
```

It's also fine (if unusual) to create an entity with no components as a kind of placeholder.

## Adding components

Once an entity has been created, it is possible to add [components](./components) to it at any time:

```ts
@component class ComponentA {
  @field.int32 declare value: number;
}
@component class ComponentB {
  @field.dynamicString(20) declare message: string;
}

// in a system, given an entity:
entity.add(ComponentA, {value: 10});
// or add multiple components at once:
entity.addAll(ComponentA, {value: 10}, ComponentB, {message: 'hello'});
```
```js
class ComponentA {
  static schema = {
    value: Type.int32
  };
}
class ComponentB {
  static schema = {
    message: Type.dynamicString(20)
  };
}

// in a system, given an entity:
entity.add(ComponentA, {value: 10});
// or add multiple components at once:
entity.addAll(ComponentA, {value: 10}, ComponentB, {message: 'hello'});
```

The arguments to `add` and `addAll` are the same as those to `createEntity` above.

Trying to add the same component type to an entity more than once will result in an error.  Adding an [enum component type](components#component-enums) will automatically [remove](#removing-components) any other component from the same enum.

## Accessing and modifying components

Components can be accessed from an entity in two ways:
- `read(Component)`: get the component for read-only operations.  (Attempts to set field values will throw an error unless you're running in [performance mode](../deploying).)
- `write(Component)`: get the component to modify its field values.

```ts
@component class ComponentA {
  @field.int32 declare value: number;
}
@component class ComponentB {
  @field.int32 declare value: number;
}

// in a system, given an entity:
entity.write(ComponentA).value += entity.read(ComponentB).value;
```
```js
class ComponentA {
  static schema = {
    value: Type.int32
  };
}
class ComponentB {
  static schema = {
    value: Type.int32
  };
}

// in a system, given an entity:
entity.write(ComponentA).value += entity.read(ComponentB).value;
```

::: danger
You must not hang on to the component handles returned by `read` and `write`, as they'll be invalidated by the next call to `read` or `write` on the same component type.
:::

These two access modes help to implement [reactive queries](./queries#reactive-queries) with minimal overhead, allowing your systems to easily get lists of entities whose components have been mutated.  Note that the component will get marked as changed even if you don't change any fields, so try to use `write` only when you know you will actually modify the component and use `read` otherwise.

Keeping these two modes distinct also makes it clear how a system is acting on components, and allows Becsy's scheduler to automatically parallelize system execution without needing to use expensive and error-prone locks.

## Removing components

Another common operation on entities is to remove components:

```ts
entity.remove(ComponentA);
entity.removeAll(ComponentA, ComponentB);
```
```js
entity.remove(ComponentA);
entity.removeAll(ComponentA, ComponentB);
```

Removing an [enum](components#component-enums) from an entity will instead remove the entity's current enum component.  Trying to remove a component that an entity doesn't have will result in an error.

Removing a component makes it disappear from the entity immediately, but Becsy actually keeps it around until the end of the next frame.  This is done so that every system that needs to react to the removal gets a chance to access the data of removed components.  You can access recently removed components like this:

```ts{6}
world.build(sys => {
  const entity = sys.createEntity(ComponentA, {value: 10});
  entity.read(ComponentA).value;  // 10
  entity.remove(ComponentA);
  // entity.read(ComponentA).value;  // error!
  sys.accessRecentlyDeletedData();
  entity.read(ComponentA).value;  // 10
})
```
```js{6}
world.build(sys => {
  const entity = sys.createEntity(ComponentA, {value: 10});
  entity.read(ComponentA).value;  // 10
  entity.remove(ComponentA);
  // entity.read(ComponentA).value;  // error!
  sys.accessRecentlyDeletedData();
  entity.read(ComponentA).value;  // 10
})
```

However you cannot write to recently deleted components.

## Checking for components

While normally you'll use [queries](./queries) to select entities with the desired combination of components, sometimes you'll need to check explicitly whether an entity has a component or not.  This is useful when writing [validators](./components#validation) but can also be used to check whether a component needs to be added or removed.

There are a few methods available for these checks:
```ts
entity.has(ComponentA);
entity.hasSomeOf(ComponentA, ComponentB);
entity hasAllOf(ComponentA, ComponentB);
entity.hasAnyOtherThan(ComponentA, ComponentB);
entity.countHas(ComponentA, ComponentB, ComponentC);
```
```js
entity.has(ComponentA);
entity.hasSomeOf(ComponentA, ComponentB);
entity hasAllOf(ComponentA, ComponentB);
entity.hasAnyOtherThan(ComponentA, ComponentB);
entity.countHas(ComponentA, ComponentB, ComponentC);
```

All these methods respect `System.accessRecentlyDeletedData()`, in case you need to check whether a component was recently removed, but [reactive queries](./queries#reactive-queries) are usually better for this.

All of the above methods (except `hasAllOf`) will accept an [enum](components#component-enums) to stand in for all its member component types.  There's also an extra method for efficiently figuring out which component of an enum is currently present on the entity, if any:

```ts
entity.hasWhich(enumA);  // returns a component type or undefined
```
```js
entity.hasWhich(enumA);  // returns a component type or undefined
```

## Deleting entities

Unlike JavaScript objects, which are automatically disposed of when they're no longer referenced, entities must be explicitly deleted like so:

```ts
entity.delete();
```
```js
entity.delete();
```

Doing so will remove all components from the entity (triggering relevant [reactive queries](./queries#reactive-queries)) then delete the entity itself.  The system deleting an entity will need to hold `write` [entitlements](queries#declaring-entitlements) for all components on the entity.  If it's hard to predict the set of possible component types a common pattern is to delegate the deletion to a dedicated system:

```ts
@component class ToBeDeleted {}

@system class SystemA extends System {
  execute() {
    // Instead of entity.delete(), just tag it:
    entity.add(ToBeDeleted);
  }
}

@system class Deleter extends System {
  // Note the usingAll.write below, which grants write entitlements on all component types.
  entities = this.query(q => q.current.with(ToBeDeleted).usingAll.write);
  execute() {
    for (const entity of this.entities.current) entity.delete();
  }
}
```
```js
class ToBeDeleted {}

class SystemA extends System {
  execute() {
    // Instead of entity.delete(), just tag it:
    entity.add(ToBeDeleted);
  }
}

class Deleter extends System {
  constructor() {
    // Note the usingAll.write below, which grants write entitlements on all component types.
    this.entities = this.query(q => q.current.with(ToBeDeleted).usingAll.write);
  }

  execute() {
    for (const entity of this.entities.current) entity.delete();
  }
}
```

Deleting an entity that has already been deleted will result in an error.

## Holding on to entity objects

The entity objects returned from `createEntity` or obtained from [queries](./queries) are ephemeral: they are only guaranteed to remain valid until the system finishes executing.  Afterwards, they may be invalidated at any time even if the entity has not yet been deleted.  (It's fine to assign these ephemeral entities to a `ref` field, though, as it keeps track of the underlying entity directly.)

To keep an entity object for longer you need to "hold" it:
```ts{6}
@system class MySystem extends System {
  private myImportantEntity: Entity;

  initialize(): void {
    const newEntity = this.createEntity(Foo, Bar);
    this.myImportantEntity = newEntity.hold();
  }

  execute(): void {
    this.myImportantEntity.read(Foo);  // OK!
  }
}
```
```js{4}
class MySystem extends System {
  initialize(): void {
    const newEntity = this.createEntity(Foo, Bar);
    this.myImportantEntity = newEntity.hold();
  }

  execute(): void {
    this.myImportantEntity.read(Foo);  // OK!
  }
}
```

A held entity handle becomes invalid shortly after the underlying entity has been deleted, at which point trying to call any method on it will result in an error.  If the lifecycle of an entity held by a system is outside its control then you should check `entity.alive` every frame and stop referencing the entity once it becomes `false`.  You're guaranteed at least one frame where `entity.alive` is `false` and the handle is still valid, but if you miss the opportunity you're out of luck.

<language-switcher/>

# Queries

A query is a set of constraints to select entities based on the components they have.  Queries are always defined in systems at construction time.  It's not possible to run new ad-hoc queries once the world has been created.

A query is always updated with the entities that match the components' condition immediately before a system is executed.  The work needed to keep a query updated is proportional to the number of shape changes (component additions and removals) in the world rather than the total number of entities.

## Basic query syntax

Queries use a small domain-specific language to express their constraints and are assigned to system properties at construction time:

```ts
@system class SystemA extends System {
  // Query for all entities with an Enemy component but no Dead component.
  private activeEnemies = this.query(
    q => q.current.with(Enemy).and.withAny(stateEnum).but.without(Dead));

  execute(): void {
    for (const entity of this.activeEnemies.current) {
      const enemy = entity.read(Enemy);  // guaranteed to have an Enemy component
    }
  }
}
```
```js
class SystemA extends System {
  constructor() {
    // Query for all entities with an Enemy component but no Dead component.
    this.activeEnemies = this.query(
      q => q.current.with(Enemy).and.withAny(stateEnum).but.without(Dead));
  }

  execute() {
    for (const entity of this.activeEnemies.current) {
      const enemy = entity.read(Enemy);  // guaranteed to have an Enemy component
    }
  }
}
```

First you specify that you want all `current` entities that satisfy the constraints; we'll introduce other options [later](#reactive-queries).  Then you constrain what component types an entity must and must not have to satisfy the query:
- an entity must have all the components listed in `with` clauses;
- an entity must have at least one of the component listed in *each* `withAny` clause;
- an entity must not have any of the components listed in `without` clauses.

Each clause can list any number of component types.  Enum types and [enums](components#component-enums) can be used in most of the clauses, but check the API docs as some combinations cannot be evaluated efficiently.

The query object will have a `current` property that's an array of entities you can iterate over in your `execute` hook.

::: tip
Queries are only updated between system executions so you don't need to worry about accidentally mutating the entity array while you're iterating over it by adding or removing components.
:::

## Declaring entitlements

Query definitions also have a secondary function:  they declare what component types the system will be reading, writing, creating and updating.  These declarations are not query-specific &mdash; the entitlements from all of a system's queries are combined together and applied to the system &mdash; but it's a convenient place to express them as you'll often need to read and write the component types that your queries are constrained on.

You can only read, write, create and update component types for which you declared entitlements, otherwise you'll get an error.  Becsy also uses the entitlements to help [order system execution](./systems#execution-order) and determine which systems can safely run concurrently.

You declare entitlements by following any clause that mentions component types with a `read`, `write`, `create` or `update`:

```ts{4}
@system class Namer extends System {
  // Select all Players that don't have a Name component yet.
  private uninitializedPlayers =
    this.query(q => q.current.with(Player).but.without(Name).write);

  execute(): void {
    for (const player of this.uninitializedPlayers.current) {
      // Add a name to each player, which will also remove it from the query.
      player.add(Name, {value: getRandomName()});
    }
  }
}
```
```js{5}
class Namer extends System {
  constructor() {
    // Select all Players that don't have a Name component yet.
    this.uninitializedPlayers =
      this.query(q => q.current.with(Player).but.without(Name).write);
  }

  execute() {
    for (const player of this.uninitializedPlayers.current) {
      // Add a name to each player, which will also remove it from the query.
      // This is a typical "factory" pattern in ECS.
      player.add(Name, {value: getRandomName()});
    }
  }
}
```

Above, we declared that we'll be writing the `Name` component; adding and removing count as writing, as does calling `Entity.write`.  Any `with` or `without` component types are automatically marked as `read` so you don't need to say it explicitly (but it's allowed).  If you want to declare an entitlement for a component type not used as a query constraint you can employ the `using` clause, which doesn't affect the query in any way, only supplies component types for entitlement suffixes:  `this.query(q => q.using(RandomComponent).write)`.

::: tip
`write` implicitly includes `read`, `create` and `update`, so you don't need to declare those separately.  `read` and `write` also grant you access to the `has` family of methods, but `create` and `update` do not, as a trade-off for being able to run concurrently.
:::

## Reactive queries

Using reactive queries make it possible to react to changes on entities and its components.

::: tip
A single query can include any or all of the various lists described below (each of which will be iterable separately), and this is more efficient than creating separate queries for them.
:::

### Added and removed entities

One common use case is to detect whenever an entity has been added or removed from a query:

```ts
@system class SystemA extends System {
  // Query for entities that either became a Box with a Transform, or stopped being one.
  private boxes = this.query(q => q.added.and.removed.with(Box, Transform));

  execute(): void {
    for (const addedBox of this.boxes.added) { /* ... */ }
    for (const removedbox of this.boxes.removed) { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```
```js
class SystemA extends System {
  constructor() {
    // Query for entities that either became a Box with a Transform, or stopped being one.
    this.boxes = this.query(q => q.added.and.removed.with(Box, Transform));
  }

  execute() {
    for (const addedBox of this.boxes.added) { /* ... */ }
    for (const removedbox of this.boxes.removed) { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

The `added` and `removed` lists are computed just before the system executes, and will include all entities that would have been added to or removed from the `current` list since the system last executed (usually the previous frame).

::: tip
If an entity was both added and then removed between system executions, it will *not* be included in the `added` list.  (And similarly for the `removed` list.)  There's currently no way to query for such ephemeral entities in Becsy.
:::

### Changed entities

Another common use case is to detect when a component's field values have been changed, whether due to a call to `Entity.write` or because the field's value was [automatically updated](./components#referencing-entities):

```ts
// Get entities with Box and Transform, where Transform fields changed since last time.
this.query(q => q.changed.with(Box).and.with(Transform).trackWrites);
```
```js
// Get entities with Box and Transform, where Transform fields changed since last time.
this.query(q => q.changed.with(Box).and.with(Transform).trackWrites);
```

We express the query as usual, but append `trackWrites` to any component types whose changes we want to track.  (You must track at least one component type.)  Note that when tracking specific enum component types, a write to another component in the same enum can sometimes trigger the query too.

Not all state changes are expressed by writes to a component's fields: sometimes, the combination of components matching a query encodes an implicit state instead.  This is especially common when using [component enums](./components#component-enums) but works with normal components too.  You mark `withAny` clauses with `trackMatches`, and they'll add entities to the `changed` list whenever set the set of components matching the `withAny` clause changes:

```ts
// Get entities with Menu, where their open/closed state changed since last time.
this.query(q => q.changed.with(Menu).and.withAny(Open, Closed).trackMatches);
```
```js
// Get entities with Menu, where their open/closed state changed since last time.
this.query(q => q.changed.with(Menu).and.withAny(Open, Closed).trackMatches);
```

You can mix `trackWrites` and `trackMatches` within a query but there's no way to tell which one caused an entity to become `changed`.

Newly added entities will *not* be included in the `changed` list, even if their fields were written to after the component was added.  Basically, an entity will be in at most one of the `added`, `removed`, and `changed` lists &mdash; they never overlap.  For convenience, you can request a list that combines any of these attributes instead:

```ts
// Get entities that became a Box with Transform, or whose Transform was changed.
this.query(q => q.addedOrChanged.with(Box).and.with(Transform).trackWrites);
```
```js
// Get entities that became a Box with Transform, or whose Transform was changed.
this.query(q => q.addedOrChanged.with(Box).and.with(Transform).trackWrites);
```

## Ordering query results

Query results are not guaranteed to be in any specific order by default, but you can request that they be sorted using any kind expression over their entities:

```ts
@system class Renderer extends System {
  // Query for all Sprites and order by ascending zIndex.
  private sprites = this.query(
    q => q.current.with(Sprite).orderBy(entity => entity.read(Sprite).zIndex)
  );

  execute(): void {
    // Iterate over all sprites in order of zIndex.
    for (const entity of this.sprites.current) {
      render(entity.read(Sprite));
    }
  }
}
```
```js
class Renderer extends System {
  constructor() {
    // Query for all Sprites and order by ascending zIndex.
    this.sprites = this.query(
      q => q.current.with(Sprite).orderBy(entity => entity.read(Sprite).zIndex)
    );
  }

  execute() {
    // Iterate over all sprites in order of zIndex.
    for (const entity of this.sprites.current) {
      render(entity.read(Sprite));
    }
  }
}
```

A common case is ordering entities by order of creation, for example to execute queued commands in the right order:

```ts
this.query(q => q.current.with(Command).write.orderBy(entity => entity.ordinal))
```
```js
this.query(q => q.current.with(Command).write.orderBy(entity => entity.ordinal))
```

Note that ordering entities can get expensive (though we apply some optimizations for common cases) so use this feature judiciously!

# Systems

Systems are used to transform data stored on the components. Usually each system defines one or more [queries](./queries) of entities and iterates through these lists once per frame to create, remove or modify entities and components.

![Wolves and dragons](https://ecsy.io/docs/manual/images/systems.svg)

## Defining systems

Each system is defined as a class with a public default constructor that extends `System`:

```ts
@system class MySystem extends System {
  execute(): void {
    // do some work here
  }
}
```
```js
class MySystem extends System {
  execute(): void {
    // do some work here
  }
}
```

::: only-ts
The optional `@system` decorator will automatically register the system with the world when you create it.  If you omit the decorator then you'll need to include the system class in the [world's `defs`](./world#options) one way or another.
:::

::: only-js
To make the world aware of your system so it'll be excuted, you'll need to include the system class in the [world's `defs`](./world#options) one way or another.
:::

While your constructors can't take any arguments, if you pass a system into `defs` you can optionally include values for any custom properties you'd like to initialize:
```ts
const world = World.create({defs: [
  AnotherSystem,
  MySystem, {defaultSpeed: 100, message: 'too fast!'},
]});
```
```js
const world = World.create({defs: [
  AnotherSystem,
  MySystem, {defaultSpeed: 100, message: 'too fast!'}
]});
```

You can't remove a system from the world but there are ways to [control which systems are executed](./world#partial-execution).

## System lifecycle

When the world is created it will instantiate a copy of every system.  The only work you should do in your constructor is to define the system's [schedule](#execution-order), create the [queries](./queries) it needs, and declare any [attachments](#attached-systems) and [singletons](#singletons).

::: warning
In multi-threading scenarios a system may be instantiated more than once so don't do anything that has side-effects in the constructor.
:::

A system will then go through a lifecycle over the lifetime of the world, that you can hook into by overriding any of the following methods:
```ts
@system class MySystem extends System {
  async prepare(): Promise<void> {}
  initialize(): void {}
  execute(): void {}
  finalize(): void {}
}
```
```js
class MySystem extends System {
  prepare() {}  // returns a promise
  initialize() {}
  execute() {}
  finalize() {}
}
```

First, the world will apply any [attachment](#attached-systems) and [singleton](#singletons) directives, so those will be available in all the hooks.

The world will then invoke `prepare`, which is the only `async` hook and can be used for loading external data or setting up some external context.  You should save any results you'll need later in your own properties on the system instance.  In this phase the system cannot yet create or access entities.

After that comes `initialize`.  This is a synchronous hook and can be used to initialize the system and its own little corner of the world.  This is usually where you'll seed the world with initial entities, add event listeners, etc.  Queries are not yet accessible in this phase.

For the bulk of the system's life, every time the world is executed ([usually](./world#partial-execution) once per frame) it will invoke `execute` on the system.  This is where you iterate over the results of [queries](./queries), create entities, mutate components, drive external systems (such as a renderer), etc.  If your computation is time-dependent you can use the current time and delta since the last frame:

```ts{5-6}
@system class MySystem extends System {
  execute(): void {
    const speed = this.player.read(Speed);
    const position = this.player.write(Position);
    position.value += speed.value * this.delta;
    position.lastUpdated = this.time;
  }
}
```
```js{5-6}
class MySystem extends System {
  execute(): void {
    const speed = this.player.read(Speed);
    const position = this.player.write(Position);
    position.value += speed.value * this.delta;
    position.lastUpdated = this.time;
  }
}
```

The time and delta are computed automatically by default but you can override them with your preferred values when calling `world.execute`.

Finally, if you explicitly terminate the world, `finalize` will be called.  This is useful for disentangling yourself from any external systems, e.g. by removing listeners.  There's no point in deleting entities here since the world is about to be destroyed anyway.

## Execution order

What order will your systems be executed in?  In principle, it doesn't matter, since if one system makes a change that a preceding system needs it'll just have to wait until the next frame to act on it.  The computation continually converges towards a point where every system has seen every relevant change.

In practice, though, this would lead to unacceptable latency in propagating changes through your systems, so we want to order their execution such that all changes are fully processed in a single frame whenever possible.  In other ECS libraries this is typically done by registering the systems in the desired order of execution or by setting system priorities.  We take a different approach.

Becsy lets you declare a partial order on your systems through powerful precedence directives, leading to an acyclic graph of systems that can be automatically linearized for single-threaded execution.  This is more complex than explicitly specifying the exact order but it allows for efficient mapping onto multi-threaded execution, and also lets you integrate third party system packages without needing to understand their internal ordering constraints.

Each system can specify its ordering constraints via a schedule builder:

```ts
@system(
  s => s.before(SystemB).afterWritesTo(ComponentFoo).inAnyOrderWith(physicsSystems)
) class SystemA extends System {}
```
```js
class SystemA extends System {
  constructor() {
    this.schedule(
      s => s.before(SystemB).afterWritesTo(ComponentFoo).inAnyOrderWith(physicsSystems)
    );
  }
}
```

::: only-ts
(If needed, you can call `this.schedule` from your constructor instead.)
:::

The scheduling constraints apply pairwise to the subject system and all other systems listed in the constraint.  More specific constraints override less specific ones on a per-system-pair basis.  Here's a list of the supported constraint clauses from most to least specific:

| Constraints | Effect |
| ----------- | ------ |
| `before`, `after` | Forces the system to execute any time (not necessarily immediately) before or after the given systems.  This is the strongest constraint. |
| `inAnyOrderWith` | Negates all less specific constraints, allowing the system to execute in any order with the given ones.  Doesn't affect ordering between the given systems, though. |
| `beforeReadersOf`, `afterReadersOf`, `beforeWritersOf`, `afterWritersOf` | Specifies that the system should execute before or after all other systems that read or write components of the given types. |
| `inAnyOrderWithReadersOf`, `inAnyOrderWithWritersOf` | Negates all automatically formed constraints, allowing the system to execute in any order with systems that read or write components of the given types. This is useful for resolving spurious ordering conflicts caused by overlapping entitlements. |
| system entitlements | [System entitlements](./queries#declaring-entitlements) to read or write certain component types are used to automatically form a basic layer of constraints, such that all systems that read a component execute after all systems that write it. |

To give a concrete example, consider the following schedule and entitlement declarations:
```ts
@system(s => s.after(C))
class A extends System {
  entities = this.query(q => q.using(Foo).read);
}

@system
class B extends System {
  entities = this.query(q => q.using(Foo).write);
}

@system
class C extends System {
  entities = this.query(q => q.using(Bar).write.using(Foo).read);
}

@system(s => s.afterReadersOf(Foo))
class D extends System {
}

@system(s => s.inAnyOrderWith(B))
class E extends System {
  entities = this.query(q => q.using(Foo).write);
}
```
```js
class A extends System {
  constructor() {
    this.schedule(s => s.after(C));
    this.entities = this.query(q => q.using(Foo).read);
}

class B extends System {
  constructor() {
    this.entities = this.query(q => q.using(Foo).write);
  }
}

class C extends System {
  constructor() {
    this.entities = this.query(q => q.using(Bar).write.using(Foo).read);
  }
}

class D extends System {
  constructor() {
    this.schedule(s => s.beforeReadersOf(Foo));
  }
}

class E extends System {
  constructor() {
    this.schedule(s => s.inAnyOrderWith(B));
    this.entities = this.query(q => q.using(Foo).write);
  }
}
```

These will form a precedence graph like this one:
```
B -\   /--> D
    |-|
E -/   \--> C ----> A
```

If the constraints lead to a cycle in the system precedence graph &mdash; for example, because `SystemA` wants to run before `SystemB` which itself wants to run before `SystemA` &mdash; then creating the world will fail with an informative error and you'll need to fix the constraints so as to remove the cycle.

::: info
Note that every write entitlement implies a read entitlement for that system, so if you have multiple systems with a write entitlement for a component this will form a precedence cycle that you'll need to resolve with a more specific constraint.
:::

The execution order applies to all lifecycle methods.

## Grouping systems

Sometimes you want to deal with systems in bulk, such as when deciding which [systems get executed](./world#partial-execution) or setting execution order constraints.  To make this easier you can create system groups:

```ts
const myGroup = System.group(SystemA, SystemB);
// --- or ---
const myGroup = System.group();
@system(myGroup) class SystemA extends System {}
@system(myGroup) class SystemB extends System {}
```
```js
const myGroup = System.group(SystemA, SystemB);
```

You can substitute groups in most places where a system type is expected and the operation will apply to all systems in the group.  The system group object also has its own `schedule` method that you can use to set constraints on all systems in the group.

```ts
@system(s => s.before(physicsGroup)) class InputManager extends System {}
physicsGroup.schedule(s => s.before(renderGroup));
```
```js
class InputManager extends System {
  constructor() {
    this.schedule(s => s.before(physicsGroup));
  }
}
physicsGroup.schedule(s => s.before(renderGroup));
```

::: only-ts
(You can specify both a group and a schedule in the `@system` decorator; the group comes first.)
:::

## Attaching systems

In the ECS paradigm system typically communicate with each other indirectly, by creating and destroying entities and components, which will update other systems' queries.  Sometimes, though, systems need to collaborate more closely, perhaps to share non-ECS data or to ensure that they're processing exactly the same query results.  For cases like these you can "attach" one system to another.

```ts{6}
@system class SystemA extends System {
  internalMap: Map<string, Entity>;
}

@system class SystemB extends System {
  private systemA = this.attach(SystemA);
  execute(): void {
    this.systemA.internalMap.get('foo');
  }
}
```
```js{9}
class SystemA extends System {
  constructor() {
    this.internalMap = new Map();
  }
}

class SystemB extends System {
  constructor() {
    this.systemA = this.attach(SystemA);
  }

  execute(): void {
    this.systemA.internalMap.get('foo');
  }
}
```

You must set the result of the `attach` method on a property of the system object, and it will become an instance of the designated system by the time your system starts its lifecycle.  (It will have a different value in the constructor, though, so don't use it there!)

::: danger
Properties holding attached systems must not be ES2022 private fields (the ones prefixed with `#`), but if you're using TypeScript it's fine if they're declared as `private`.
:::

It's fine for two systems to attach to each other and otherwise create attachment cycles.

::: warning
Attached systems will be forced into the same thread, limiting the potential for concurrency in your application.  Use this feature wisely!
:::

## Singleton components

While most component types are intended to be instantiated as components on multiple entities, some should have only one instance &mdash; for example, global settings or global state for a game.  To support this you could create an entity to hold the sole component instance and query for it in all the systems that need to reference it, but Becsy provides a shortcut.  In every system that needs to access the singleton just declare access to it like this:

```ts{6}
@component class Global {
  @field.uint8 declare state: number;
}

@system class SystemA extends System {
  private global = this.singleton.write(Global);
  execute(): void {
    this.global.state = 1;
  }
}
```
```js{9}
class Global {
  static schema = {
    state: Type.uint8
  };
}

class SystemA extends System {
  constructor() {
    this.global = this.singleton.write(Global);
  }

  execute() {
    this.global.state = 1;
  }
}
```

::: danger
Properties holding singletons must not be ES2022 private fields (the ones prefixed with `#`), but if you're using TypeScript it's fine if they're declared as `private`.
:::

You can declare a singleton with either `read` or `write` access and Becsy will automatically create an entity to hold it, add the component, set its storage strategy to `compact` with a capacity of 1, and return a handle that you can use throughout the system's lifecycle.  Naturally, once you declare a component type as a singleton you can no longer add it to your own entities.

One thing to watch out for is that any singletons declared with `write` access will track a change event every time the system executes, whether the system made any changes to the component's value or not.  If you have a `changed` query tracking a singleton component and the system doesn't actually update it every frame, you should instead move the `this.singleton.write` call into your `execute` method.  This will give you a writable handle and track changes only when you need it, though you'll need to explicitly claim a write entitlement to the component type and you'll still need to declare the singleton in the usual way in another system (with `this.singleton.read` in the constructor) to get it set up correctly.

::: warning
Keep in mind that any systems with write access to a singleton will not be able to run concurrently, just like with any other component type.
:::

## Coroutines

Sometimes the work a system needs to do in response to an event takes more than one frame &mdash; for example, an animation followed by adding one to a counter, or a delay before some effect is deactivated.  You can always keep track of the work's state in a component and perhaps use a separate dedicated system to handle progress, but this can split notionally sequential behaviors among many pieces of code and make them harder to understand.  In those cases you can consider using coroutines instead.

A coroutine is a flow of execution that's attached to a system but has its own call stack and context.  It can suspend its own execution to wait for some event to occur (e.g., wait for the next frame) then resume execution with the context intact.  Coroutines are also easy to cancel &mdash; including entire stacks of them! &mdash; so they work well for complex behaviors that may not run to conclusion.

Here's a simple example:

```ts
@system class IntroSlideshow extends System {
  private slide = this.singleton.write(Slide);

  initialize(): void {
    this.runSlideshow(1.5);  // start a coroutine
  }

  @co *runSlideshow(delay: number) {
    this.slide.value = 1;
    yield co.waitForSeconds(delay);  // suspend execution for delay seconds
    this.slide.value = 2;
    yield co.waitForFrames(2);       // subliminal slide! suspend for 2 frames
    this.slide.value = 3;
    yield co.waitForSeconds(delay);  // suspend execution for delay seconds
    this.slide.value = 0;  // all done
  }
}
```
```js
class IntroSlideshow extends System {
  private slide = this.singleton.write(Slide);

  initialize(): void {
    this.start(this.runSlideshow, 1.5);  // start a coroutine
  }

  *runSlideshow(delay: number) {
    this.slide.value = 1;
    yield co.waitForSeconds(delay);  // suspend execution for delay seconds
    this.slide.value = 2;
    yield co.waitForFrames(2);       // subliminal slide! suspend for 2 frames
    this.slide.value = 3;
    yield co.waitForSeconds(delay);  // suspend execution for delay seconds
    this.slide.value = 0;  // all done
  }
}
```

::: only-ts
Coroutines are declared as generator methods with the `@co` decorator.  You can invoke them directly from the system's lifecycle methods, or from other coroutines (in which case prefix the call with `yield` to wait for the coroutine to complete).
:::

::: only-js
Coroutines are declare as generator methods.  You use the `start` method to start one from a lifecycle method, or call them directly from other coroutines prefixed with `yield`.
:::

A system's running coroutines are executed each frame immediately after the call to `execute`, in the reverse order in which they were started.

The return value when starting a coroutine is a handle that has the cancellation API; you can also access it from inside a coroutine via `co`.  The handle is stable so you can hang on to it until the coroutine exits or is cancelled.

```ts{6-7,12}
@system class IdleStart extends System {
  // Query for activity components that will signal us to end the initial idle behavior.
  private activity = this.query(q => q.current.with(Activity));

  initialize(): void {
    // Start the idle behavior coroutine, and cancel once Activity entities appear.
    this.doIdle().cancelIf(() => this.activity.current.length);
  }

  @co *doIdle() {
    // ... do stuff ...
    if (someSpecialCondition) co.cancel();
  }
}
```
```js{8-9,14}
class IdleStart extends System {
  constructor() {
    // Query for activity components that will signal us to end the initial idle behavior.
    this.activity = this.query(q => q.current.with(Activity));
  }

  initialize(): void {
    // Start the idle behavior coroutine, and cancel once Activity entities appear.
    this.start(this.doIdle).cancelIf(() => this.activity.current.length);
  }

  *doIdle() {
    // ... do stuff ...
    if (someSpecialCondition) co.cancel();  // cancel immediately
  }
}
```

Pending cancellation conditions are evaluated every frame, before coroutines are resumed.

Finally, it's often the case that a system will need to kick off a coroutine for each entity in a query, so there's some special support for this use case.  You can set a coroutine's `scope`, so the coroutine will automatically be canceled if the entity is deleted, and gain access to more advanced cancellation conditions.

```ts{18-20}
@component class Zombie {
  @field.boolean declare dancing: boolean;
}

@system class DanceOrWalk extends System {
  private zombies = this.query(q => q.current.with(Zombie).write);

  execute(): void {
    for (const zombie of this.zombies.current) {
      const beDancing = Math.random() < 0.5;
      if (beDancing === zombie.dancing) continue;
      zombie.dancing = beDancing;
      if (beDancing) this.dance(zombie.hold()); else this.walk(zombie.hold());
    }
  }

  @co *dance(zombie: Entity) {
    co.scope(zombie);  // scope ourselves to our very own zombie
    co.cancelIfComponentMissing(Zombie);  // cancel if our zombie gets better
    co.cancelIfCoroutineStarted();  // cancel if our zombie starts another coroutine in this system
    while (true) {
      // ... dance zombie, dance!
      yield;
    }
  }

  @co *walk(zombie: Entity) {
    // ... as above
  }
}
```

```js{24-26}
class Zombie {
  static schema = {
    dancing: Type.boolean
  };
}

class DanceOrWalk extends System {
  private zombies = this.query(q => q.current.with(Zombie).write);

  execute() {
    for (const zombie of this.zombies.current) {
      const beDancing = Math.random() < 0.5;
      if (beDancing === zombie.dancing) continue;
      zombie.dancing = beDancing;
      if (beDancing) {
        this.start(this.dance, zombie.hold());
      } else {
        this.start(this.walk, zombie.hold());
      }
    }
  }

  *dance(zombie) {
    co.scope(zombie);  // scope ourselves to our very own zombie
    co.cancelIfComponentMissing(Zombie);  // cancel if our zombie gets better
    co.cancelIfCoroutineStarted();  // cancel if our zombie starts another coroutine in this system
    while (true) {
      // ... dance zombie, dance!
      yield;
    }
  }

  *walk(zombie) {
    // ... as above
  }
}
```

# World

A world is basically a container for entities, components and systems, and you'll usually want to have exactly one in your application.  You create a world like so:

```js
const world = await World.create();
```
```ts
const world = await World.create();
```

You can then execute all the world's systems at any time by calling:
```js
await world.execute();  // use Becsy's built-in clock
await world.execute(time, delta);  // or control the clock yourself
```
```ts
await world.execute();  // use Becsy's built-in clock
await world.execute(time, delta);  // or control the clock yourself
```

You'll typically do this in some kind of loop, perhaps using `requestAnimationFrame` or one of the many game loop libraries out there.

## Options

The `create` method accepts an object with many options, the most important of which is `defs`: an arbitrarily nested array of [component](./components) and [system](./systems) types for the world to be aware of.  The order of items and nesting of arrays doesn't matter &mdash; specifically, it doesn't affect the order that systems are executed in whatsoever.  You can also follow each system type with an object to be assigned onto the system instance's properties.  If you defined any [system groups](./systems#groups) they should also be listed here, and will automatically add all their systems.

<div class="only-ts">

::: tip
You can usually omit `defs` altogether as any classes decorated with `@component` or `@system` will automatically be added to the `defs` of every world you create.
:::

</div>

Another important option is `maxEntities`, which specifies the maximum number of entities your world will be able to hold at one time.  It must be set up front and cannot be raised once a world has been created.  It's set to a reasonable default and you'll get an error advising you to raise it if you should exceed it.  (Note that deleted entities continue counting against the total for up to 2 frames until they're purged.)  There are also a number of other buffer sizing options that are defaulted based on the maximum number of entities, and where again an error will tell you if you need to raise their values.

## Creating entities

You may want to set up some initial entities to populate your world.  Normally you'd leave this up to your systems, but you can also do it directly here.  Note, however, that all your systems will have already been initialized by the time world-level entities are created.

The easiest way to create an entity is like so:
```js
world.createEntity(ComponentFoo, {foo: 'bar', baz: 42}, ComponentBar);
```
```ts
world.createEntity(ComponentFoo, {foo: 'bar', baz: 42}, ComponentBar);
```

This creates an entity that contains components of the given types.  Each type can also be followed by initial values to assign to the component's fields.

The method above *doesn't* return a handle to the entity created.  If you need that &mdash; for example to initialize some `ref` fields &mdash; then you should use the second form that gives you access to a fake system:
```js
world.build(sys => {
  const entity1 = sys.createEntity(ComponentFoo);
  sys.createEntity(ComponentBar, {fooRef: entity1});
});
```
```ts
world.build(sys => {
  const entity1 = sys.createEntity(ComponentFoo);
  sys.createEntity(ComponentBar, {fooRef: entity1});
});
```

::: warning
Be careful not to exfiltrate entity handles from the build block without first [calling `hold()`](./entities#holding-handles) on the entity.
:::

## Multiple worlds

While usually one world is enough sometimes you'll want more, in which case there's an important limitation to be aware of:  a single component type can only be used in one world at a time due to performance concerns.  (This doesn't apply to systems.)

The limitation doesn't apply in unit tests (`NODE_ENV=test`) as you'll often want one world per test there, and the worlds will never execute concurrently.

Outside of tests, if you need multiple consecutive worlds then calling `world.terminate()` will make all its component types available for the next world.  If, on the other hand, you want multiple worlds to gain control over which systems to execute when, keep reading!

## Partial execution

There are some more advanced use cases where you don't want every system to execute once in every frame.  For example, you may have different systems running in different scenes in your game, or you want to run your physics systems at a fixed time interval but sync the render systems to the screen's refresh.  Becsy caters for these scenarios in two ways.

### Start / stop

First, you can explicitly stop and restart systems like so:
```js
world.control({
  stop: [SystemA, systemGroupB],    // these systems will be stopped
  restart: [SystemC, systemGroupD]  // these systems will be started
});
```
```ts
world.control({
  stop: [SystemA, systemGroupB],    // these systems will be stopped
  restart: [SystemC, systemGroupD]  // these systems will be started
});
```

This will stop the given systems and restart others.  The effect is immediate unless you're in the middle of a frame, in which case it will take effect at the end of the frame.  You'll typically use custom [system groups](./systems#groups) as arguments here but you can actually pass in anything that the world `defs` accepts and irrelevant items will just be ignored.

Stopped systems will have nearly zero impact on frame latency.  However, restarting a system that has queries is a fairly slow operation so you don't want to be doing that too often.

### Custom executor

If you do need to control what systems execute on a frame-by-frame basis then you'll want the second option: create a custom executor.

```js
// First, create a new frame with all the groups you may want to execute
const frame = world.createCustomExecutor(physicsGroup, renderGroup);

async run() {
  // then later, in your game loop, you begin a new frame:
  await frame.begin();
  // execute any groups from the list above, any number of times:
  await frame.execute(physicsGroup);
  await frame.execute(physicsGroup, time, delta);  // optionally assume control of the clock
  await frame.execute(renderGroup);
  // and close out the frame:
  await frame.end();
}
```
```ts
// First, create a new frame with all the groups you may want to execute
const frame = world.createCustomExecutor(physicsGroup, renderGroup);

async run() {
  // then later, in your game loop, you begin a new frame:
  await frame.begin();
  // execute any groups from the list above, any number of times:
  await frame.execute(physicsGroup);
  await frame.execute(physicsGroup, time, delta);  // optionally assume control of the clock
  await frame.execute(renderGroup);
  // and close out the frame:
  await frame.end();
}
```

This approach is efficient, but beware: *every group in your custom executor must be executed regularly*, though not necessarily every frame.  The longer the interval between all groups being executed, the larger the world's buffer requirements and the higher the latency when you do finally execute a group.
