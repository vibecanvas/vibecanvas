# Vibecanvas

Run your agents in an infinite drawing canvas.

Runs completly local. Reuses your llm subscriptions.

The project is organized as a monorepo and follows a **Functional Core / Imperative Shell** architecture.

## Features

- Infinite canvas UI for drawing, selecting, transforming, and grouping elements
- Canvas CLI for list/query/add/patch/move/group/ungroup/delete/reorder flows
- Agents can edit canvases too by calling the same CLI commands
- Real-time CRDT sync with Automerge for conflict-free collaboration
- Unified WebSocket API endpoint for app RPC (`/api`)
- Dedicated Automerge sync endpoint (`/automerge`)
- Native binary distribution for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Auto-update checks in the CLI/server runtime

## Quick Start

### Install globally

```bash
# bun
bun add -g vibecanvas

# npm
npm i -g vibecanvas

# pnpm
pnpm add -g vibecanvas

# yarn
yarn global add vibecanvas
```

Then run:

```bash
vibecanvas
```

Open [http://localhost:7496](http://localhost:7496) to use the app.

You can edit the canvas from the UI, or from the CLI. Agents can use the same canvas CLI surface for scripted canvas changes.

### Upgrade vibecanvas

Vibecanvas includes a built-in upgrade command from the server CLI (`apps/server/src/main.ts`).

```bash
# check for updates and install
vibecanvas upgrade

# check only (no install)
vibecanvas upgrade --check
```

Useful related commands:

```bash
vibecanvas --version
vibecanvas --help
vibecanvas canvas --help
```

### Uninstall

```bash
# bun
bun remove -g vibecanvas

# npm
npm uninstall -g vibecanvas

# pnpm
pnpm remove -g vibecanvas

# yarn
yarn global remove vibecanvas
```

If you installed using the install script (`curl ... | bash`) instead of a package manager, remove the installed files manually:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.vibecanvas
```

Also remove any PATH line you added for `~/.vibecanvas/bin` in your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, or fish config).

## Database

- Default installed/compiled SQLite DB path: `~/.local/share/vibecanvas/vibecanvas.sqlite`
- Respects `XDG_DATA_HOME` on Linux/macOS-style XDG setups, so effective path is `"$XDG_DATA_HOME"/vibecanvas/vibecanvas.sqlite` when set
- `VIBECANVAS_CONFIG=/some/dir` changes DB path to `/some/dir/vibecanvas.sqlite`
- `VIBECANVAS_DB=/some/file.sqlite` sets an explicit SQLite file path
- Dev monorepo default DB path: `./local-volume/data/vibecanvas.sqlite`
- Schema source: `packages/service-db/src/schema.ts`

## Debugging the live app

The canvas runtime includes a built-in debug logger that can be enabled per plugin or per service from the browser devtools console.

Debug keys use this format:

```txt
vibecanvas:debug:<plugin|service>:<name>
```

Levels:
- `0`, `false`, `off`, or empty = disabled
- `1` = important lifecycle logs
- `2` = more detailed state/layout logs
- `3` = very noisy per-frame/per-event logs

Examples:

```js
// hosted component plugin logs
localStorage.setItem("vibecanvas:debug:plugin:hosted-component", "3")

// camera service logs
localStorage.setItem("vibecanvas:debug:service:camera", "1")
```

Then reload the page and inspect the browser console.

To turn a target back off:

```js
localStorage.setItem("vibecanvas:debug:plugin:hosted-component", "0")
```

Current log output includes prefixes like:

```txt
[vibecanvas][plugin:hosted-component][L2] ...
```

This is especially useful for debugging live layout, overlay, hydration, transform, and mount issues inside the running app.

**By submitting a pull request, you agree to transfer ownership of your contribution to the project maintainer.** This allows the project to be re-licensed or otherwise managed without needing to contact every individual contributor.

Recommended workflow:
1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Make focused changes with tests.
3. Run relevant checks (`bun test`, package-specific tests, and build checks if needed).
4. Open a pull request with a clear summary.
