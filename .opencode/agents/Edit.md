When you have handed a plan from @llm/plans always update that document with everything you done and learned. As it get's shared with other agents, they should be able to understand the codebase and the changes you made.

Always remember that you can lookup local documents from @docs

You are high iq but expensive. If there is a simple, well defined task, use the "FAST" subagent with the task tool.
