# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.3.1

### Added
- Added registered filesystem discovery via the filesystem API so clients can list available filesystem identities.
- Added CLI filesystem bootstrapping that persists a machine identity and ensures a local filesystem row exists on startup.

### Changed
- Threaded optional `filesystemId` through filesystem and PTY API contracts to prepare local/remote machine routing.
- Updated filesystem and PTY service interfaces so service-layer calls now operate on an explicit filesystem identity.

### Fixed
- Filetree permission errors: Now shows permission errors instead of crashing.

## 0.3.0

### Added
- Added a full canvas CLI workflow for creating, listing, querying, adding, patching, moving, reordering, grouping, ungrouping, and deleting canvas elements.
- Introduced plugin system for apps/cli
- Added PTY image upload API support for writing pasted clipboard images to remote temp storage and returning the absolute server path.
- Added shared `@vibecanvas/orpc-client` package so frontend and canvas use the same ORPC websocket client and safe API types.

### Changed
- Replaces apps/server with apps/cli
- Moved filetree ownership fully into the canvas document and removed the separate filetrees table/schema from the database.
- Replaced canvas-side handwritten ORPC safe client mirror types with the shared `@vibecanvas/orpc-client` types.
- Renamed hosted widget transport wiring from `safeClient` to `apiService` across canvas/frontend integration for clearer ownership.

### Fixed
- Fixed hosted terminal image paste on deployed/remote setups by uploading clipboard images to PTY temp storage and inserting the returned shell-escaped remote path into the terminal.
- Kept unsupported non-text terminal paste payloads on the existing Ctrl+V fallback path.
- Fixed live canvas scene updates so Automerge changes from remote/CLI/server mutations now appear without a page refresh.

## 0.2.2

### Fixed
- Fixed hosted terminal and other hosted widgets getting stuck non-interactive after resize, so focus returns normally once the transform completes.
- Made PTY terminal websocket connections more resilient by switching the canvas terminal transport to PartySocket reconnecting websockets.
- Fixed hosted terminal Ctrl+C handling by replacing the broken Bun PTY backend with `bun-pty`, so terminal interrupts now reach the foreground process instead of echoing `^C` as literal input.

## 0.2.1

### Fixed
- Persisted native canvas drag position updates for hosted widgets and iframe browser widgets so reload restores the latest location.
- Fixed selection style menu updates so dragging a stylable element or group and then changing color/width/font/curve no longer snaps it back to its pre-drag position.
- Fixed broken TypeScript typings
- Fixed filetree-to-terminal drops so dropping a file or folder onto a hosted terminal inserts the shell-escaped path, focuses the terminal, and keeps blank-canvas drops creating hosted widgets.
